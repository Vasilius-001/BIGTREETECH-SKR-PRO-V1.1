# BIGTREETECH-SKR-PRO-V1.x
Aiming at some problems existing in 3D printed motherboards in the market. Bigtree Technology Co., Ltd. launched a high performance 3D printer master board with STM32F407ZGT6 as the core controller, BIGTREETECH-SKR-PRO-V1.x.

## Product introduction
BigTree Technology Co., Ltd. developed this board to provide a high performance
customizable 3D printer controller board to the 3D printing community . It also stimulates
further development of high speed and high quality 3D printing.
## Main Features
- The board is controlled by a STMicroelectronics ARM Cortex M4 32-bit
STM32F407ZGT6 MCU. This chip has a Maximum Clock Frequency of 168 MHZ and
feautures 114 I/O pins. Supported interface types are: CAN, I2C, SDIO, I2S / SPI,
UART / USART, USB. As many as 20 expansion ports can be inverted, and extended
ports can be used to add more features to the printer without worrying about the
shortage of I/O pins.
- 6 stepper motor driver ports make it possible to have up to 3 extruders or dual axis.
Supported drivers are TMC 5160, TMC 2208, TMC 2209, LV8729, ST820, A4988, etc.
There are also three dedicated fan ports with direct connection to the power
supply.
- Dedicated power input ports for the main power, stepper motors and the heated
bed, allows the user to have different input voltages. The heated bed current draw
can be reduced to 1/4, without power loss.
- Supports serial WIFI printing. To make use of this, a ESP8266 ESP-01S WIFI module
is needed.
- Supports open source firmware Marlin2.0. This means it is convenient for users
tocustomize their firmware and develop it. The firmware is upgraded with a SD
card, which is very convenient and efficient!
- Dedicated ports for BL Touch, PWM, ADC, UART, I2C and SPI. Supports TMC2130 SPI,
TMC5160 SPI, TMC2208 UART.
- Data can be saved when the power to the board is cut off and the printer can also
automatically shutdown after a print is finished. To make use of this, a
BIGTREETECH MINI UPS V1.0 and a BIGTREETECH Relay V1.0 are needed.
- The high performance heated bed MOSFET provides good heat dissipation.
- Supported screens: BIGTREETECH 2.8 inch TFT and BIGTREETECH 3.5 inch TFT color
touch screens, LCD2004 and LCD1286. These are just a few compatible screens,
there are more options.
- Multi language support, for example: English, Chinese, Simplified Chinese.
- Using removable automotive fuses makes the replacement process easier.
- The layout of the PCB is optimized for heat dissipation.
